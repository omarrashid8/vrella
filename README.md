  <h3 align="center">vrella, discord multi-tool</h3>
  <p align="center">
    discord multi-tool, the most features packed into a single client: with only one client-login, featuring 24+ commands & customizable features. 
  </p>
<p align="center">
  honestly, it's the best multi-tool based client for discord out there, and it's free. (closed-source, of course)
